# MIFIS FeFET Simulation

Ferroelectric FeFET simulation framework (1D/2D/3D)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run simulations
python main.py 1d      # 1D baseline
python main.py 2d      # 2D planar
python main.py 3d      # 3D GAA
python main.py all     # All dimensions
```

Results saved in `results/` and `plots/` directories.
